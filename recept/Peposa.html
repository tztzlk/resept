    <h1>Peposa Dell'Impruneta</h1>

    <p>
        The story goes that terracotta tile workers in Impruneta, Tuscany, would place this stew into clay pots 
        and cook it in their still-hot kilns overnight where it would be ready in the morning. They used a lot 
        of pepper because the meat was not always top quality. The amount of pepper is up to you--I used a ridiculous 
        amount, but even so it wasn't overpowering.
